		<h2>My Goals for Galvanize</h2>
		
		<p>
		I have a few reasons I wanted to join Galvanize:
		</p>
		<ul>
				<li>I geniunely enjoy coding. Seeing the results of my work is important to me, which is something I can do everyday with code</li>
				<li>I have been self-teaching for a couple of years without outside input, so I'm lost on where to go next</li>
				<li>I have worked in PM and QA roles on Agile projects in the past and I felt like I had no idea what's going on due to lack of technical knowledge. I want to become more knowledgable, and not feel like this ever again:</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
My goal for Galvanize is to better understand programming concepts. I have seen developers at prior jobs relying heavily on Stackoverflow for their work, and that's something I hope to avoid. I want a solid conceptual understanding of how code works so that I never feel completely stuck when I run into new problems during my career.
		</p>
		<p>
As for an ideal role, I haven't decided exactly what I want to do next. I have a deep passion for Fintech, but I would like to gain experience at a consultancy like Pivotal for a few years before entering the startup world. As for now I plan on leaving my options open to whatever dev job will help grow my skillset the most.

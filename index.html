 			<h2>Hi! I'm Danny</h2>
			<p>
I'm a Colorado native: Boulder born, raised by the rough & tumble streets of Longmont, CSU educated, and I now reside in Denver. I had a brief stint in Florida for 2 years where I consulted for Accenture making tech dreams come true at the <span class='pic1'>happiest place on earth</span>.  After that, I put my Finance degree to work at Oracle where I quickly discovered Finance wasn't as thrilling as I expected (who would've thunk it?). So now I have decided to jump back into tech by joining Galvanize.
			</p>	
			<p>
I am a fitness fanatic. I love tinkering with workout routines, exercises, and supplements to test results & gains. My favorite outdoor activities include <span class='pic2'>backpacking</span>, skiing, paddleboarding, and trail running.  I also just picked up <span class='pic3'>sailing</span> this last summer and I hope to spend much more time in 2016 out on Carter lake. 

			<p>I love animals. My life is currently dictated by a 9-lb cat named <span class='pic4'>Muffins</span> that is generous enough to let me live in her house.
